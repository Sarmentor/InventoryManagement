# Abstract

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been applied to several areas or tasks ranging from energy networks controlling to robot soccer teams. MAS are the ideal solution when they provide decision support in situations where human decision and actions are not feasible to operate the system in control and in real-time. Thus, we present a case study that is related to dynamic simulation of an automatic inventory management system. We provide two types of agents, the clients, and the seller agents. Through a system of communication, the agents exchange messages to fulfill their inventory needs. The client agents trade products in quantities according to their needs and rely on seller agents if other clients in the retailer chain cannot provide the needed items. Additionally, it is expected that the trading between a client and the sellers is done through a reverted type of auction. This case study MAS uses BDI and FIPA-ACL in its implementation resulting in a clear simulation of the system. We expect to provide a comparison between two distinct situations. One with only external transactions with providers, and a situation where both internal and external transactions are allowed.
